For 10 portions:
* 1 l Double cream (33%)
* 150 g sugar
* 6 sheets of gelatine
* 1 vanilla pod

* 300 g strawberries
* 120 g sugar
* 1/2 lemon's juice
* 3 g pectin

Soak gelatin in cold water for a few minutes, squeeze. Slice the vanilla pod lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.
Place the cream, sugar, vanilla seeds and the pod in a saucepan. Dissolve the gelatin in them, stirring occasionally. When it comes to almost a boil, turn off and divide into jars through a sieve. Allow to cool and refrigerate for a couple of hours.
Place all the ingredients for the strawberry salsa in the pan and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves, and then until the strawberries soften. Place a few spoonfuls of warm salsa on top of the thickened panna cotta in jars. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
